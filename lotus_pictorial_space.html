        <h3 class="title">Intro</h3>
            <p>
                For VSST 108, our final projects involved creating a story with an alternate universe and bringing it to life by combining different pictures and elements in Photoshop and Illustrator. The project emphasized monotone black and white, and having a proper foreground, middle ground, and background to create a seamless image. It was essential to think about shading and other design elements like atmospheric diminution, and how that plays a part in a proper landscape. 
            </p>
        <h3 class="title">Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                We were able to take creative liberties for this project, as long as we created a pictorial space with a dedicated story that we could attach. I wanted to pull in aspects of my culture for this project, so I drew inspiration from lotus flowers, a symbol of the Hindu goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati, who represent wealth and wisdom respectively. I combined the images of cities, gardens, fountains, lotus flowers, and a girl. To create this project, I used different tools in Photoshop to isolate the original photos and put certain elements into the picture.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the requirements for this project was to include a geographic intervention in our pictorial spaces. To stick with the lotus and sci-fi theme, I decided to create a floating geographic lotus. I made it in Photoshop by creating the crystal shapes and using shading techniques to integrate them with the pictorial space. Since VSST 108 focused on black and white color, I made the lotus petals vary in shades of gray and considered the shadows that would affect its composition. As part of the final critique, we had to paint the geometric intervention and see if it would still integrate with the printed pictorial space. It demonstrated our knowledge of digital media and traditional acrylic painting techniques, and Iâ€™m proud of how it came out!
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the journey was very hard since I hadn't used Photoshop before and to make the pictorial space look complete, you had to be really good with it. But with the help and advice of my professor, I was slowly able to get the hang of everything and improve. I'm glad I had the opportunity to apply my imagination and love of storytelling to design, in a way that I never thought I could do before.
