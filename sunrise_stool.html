        <h3 class="title">Intro</h3>
            <p>
                My second project in Product Design was to design a product by picking a mythological creature and drawing a common household object at random to create something that embodied the creature's qualities. Out of my professor’s graduation cap, I picked a phoenix, and my object was a stool. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was challenging to think of a way a flying, free phoenix would embody a grounded stool, and initially, people thought the idea was funny and said I would have a hard time with this project. However, I felt intrigued and thought about how I could connect them both meaningfully. I had to think outside the box, thinking not just about physical qualities and meanings, but how to bring the humanistic aspect of both into my product. 
            </p>
        <h3 class="title"> Discovery: Research </h3>
            <p>
                To start the project, I had to research both the phoenix and the stool, learning more about their histories, symbolism, and how they have been used in society.
            </p>
            <p>
                My creature was a phoenix, which is immortal even though it completes its life cycle. It lives in a well in Arabia and travels to the City of the Sun, where Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun lights it on fire and it burns to ashes. Its journey inspires, and it represents rebirth, power, and hope.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stool exists in different forms and is very functional. The origins are unknown, but it started with a 3-legged stool and was very accessible as they were for I focused on the 4-legged stool, which is very common and used in collaborative settings. Many materials can be used, including wood, metal, and plastic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another element we had to think about was the user experience of our object. How was it used, and in what situations? How would the user think while using it? What were its social and cultural implications? I took these questions and insights to delve deeper into my solution.
            </p>
        <h3 class="title"> Define and Develop: Ideations, Reflections, and Insights </h3>
            <p>
                To create a stool embodying the phoenix, I wanted to focus on the life cycle of the phoenix, its ability to transform, and how it always changes. I also wanted to incorporate the stool’s stability, and how that would influence my product to be a reliable one. The most important thought to consider was how the movement of the phoenix would translate into a stool, which is stationary.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the defining stage, we created mind maps. I used the idea of the life cycle and rebirth of the phoenix and fused its stability and ability to transform with how I wanted my stool to be.

                When ideating, I thought “How might we design a stool with the groundedness of nature and uplifting hope of the immortal, transforming phoenix?” I wanted to highlight those features.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had the opportunity to ideate continuously on a large scroll of paper, just thinking of connections and how we could create a product that encompassed all that we wanted our product to be. I formed connections between the messages and ideas that phoenixes portrayed, and how stools not only represented a seat, but a simple tool used in places of communication. From my ideations, I took these ideas and combined them into a transformational stool. I was kind of worried that the simplicity of the stool would hinder my transformational aspect, but it worked out. I pulled these elements out of my ideations to create a product that contained all the aspects I liked. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before fully continuing with the product, we had to bring in the subject of empathy and fully put the idea into perspective. I drew inspiration from my own home for this part and empathized with so many others who would have also been in my situation. I’ve lived in a small apartment my whole life, and with that came many times when we didn’t have a lot of space. I wanted to create a stool that would take into account small spaces, and give people hope and a sense of community since that would have reassured me that our situation would change, and I would soon get a house to give back to my family. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For my initial storyboard, I tried to emphasize how stools are pretty clunky, and aren’t ideal for storage. My initial idea was to have stacking stools, but they didn’t have the aesthetic I was looking for. I wanted to adapt my ideas to fit users who wanted to bring people to their homes but also wanted seats that wouldn’t take up space once guests were gone. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Stools are very versatile objects, but for my product, I wanted to focus on the ability for it to be a reliable place to sit and communicate with others. We often see stools used in classrooms, but I wanted to add the sophistication of the phoenix to its build and the thoughtfulness of its qualities to the materials. So how do we combine that?
            </p>
        <h3 class="title"> Delivering the Product: Design Statement and Solution </h3>
            <h5> Design Pitch: </h5>
            <p>
                A stool is a stable surface that we use so often that it's normal. What if we could take the unassuming stool, which we use to do work, talk, and collaborate with others, and give it a sense of liveliness and pizzazz? This is where the Sunrise Stool Set comes in! It encapsulates the striking features of the phoenix, a legendary bird that dies a fiery death and is reborn anew. The sunrise stool set is comprised of 4 wooden stools and a table, engraved with drawings of the phoenix and its glory. The stool set means that no stool will be alone, and you can collaborate with others! But there's more! The 4 stools can be stored in the table, allowing for versatility depending on how many guests you are hosting. The sunrise stools fit into a centerpiece that is sure to upgrade any space. Embody the inspiration of the rising sun and stay grounded while reaching new heights!
            </p>
            <p>
                My final design consisted of a set of 4 stools that nest into a table. I chose wood as my material since it comes from the earth, goes back to the earth, and burns into ash just like the rebirth cycle of the phoenix. The legs of the stool fit together, and the distance between each leg becomes shorter so they don’t obstruct each other. There are 4 ways to arrange the stools, and you can take out as many as you need. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And this is the design of the stool! The red-toned wood has patterns engraved with gold, and the stools show the phoenix’s life cycle while the table shows its journey. There is the image of the Arabian well, mountains, and trees to symbolize strength and groundedness, and the city where the phoenix restarts its cycle. I put a sun in the middle, to tie it into the phoenix story. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My final storyboard encapsulates my Sunrise Stool set and the experience I want the user to have with it! I wanted to embody how the Sunrise Stool Set could be used to help one person sit down, but in case there are more people, the Sunrise Stool can accommodate up to 3 other people. It’s compact as a whole not taking up space, and the story it tells is a wonderful talking piece to stimulate conversation and inspiration, just like an eternal phoenix!
            </p>
        <h2 class="title"> Reflection </h2>
            <p>
                This project was one of my favorites in this class. Even though it was an individual project, I'm proud of the steps that I took and the ideas that I created so that I could deliver the best possible project I could.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoyed the amount of sketching and drawing in this project since it took me back to my time as an engineering student in high school and drawing out prototypes. It made me realize that I thrive in situations where I'm able to think of new ideas in a formative and positive way, especially if the goal is to help people. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If I had the chance to do this again, I would make a physical prototype to add to the experience and further enhance the communication aspect, since it'll be a conversation starter! But I'm happy that despite the initial challenge of connecting a flying phoenix to a stationary stool, I made it work and turned it into an even more meaningful piece because of the story I connected to it.
