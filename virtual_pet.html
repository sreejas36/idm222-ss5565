        <h3 class="title">Intro</h3>
            <p>
                For this Project, the class focused on creating a Finite State Machine for a virtual pet that would respond in certain ways due to a combination of buttons pressed. The user would get to interact with and play with the pet, similar to a Tamagotchi. It was necessary to have at least 5 different states for the virtual pet. Pressing on a certain button forms a certain input that would lead to a specific output. 
            </p>
        <h3 class="title"> My Project </h3>
            <p>
                For this project, I chose Shooky, a character from BT21 made by Suga of BTS, as my virtual pet. Shooky is a mischievous tiny cookie who loves pranking others but hates milk. He loves hanging out with his best friend Cooky, a pink bunny. 
                I chose to use Shooky because he’s a charming character and he had a lot of facial expressions, perfect for the states that I wanted him to portray in my project. He’s a small cookie that pretends to be tough but is pretty scared, and I felt like he would make a nice pet for this project.

        <h2 class="title"> Reflection </h2>
            <p>
                This project was one of my first college coding projects and coding for a project was new to me. Learning how to create and code from scratch for a certain purpose helped me have a deeper understanding of UX and the programming that comes with it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The workflow for Finite State Machine (FSM) is similar to how different pages are linked together in Figma, a design software. Both give a different result based on how one interacts with it. Even though I didn’t know it then, this project bridged my understanding of the connection that comes with UXID. I’m able to grasp the content better because I pulled knowledge from other topics and experiences I know!
            </p>
            <p>
                This project increased my confidence in coding, so now in my web authoring class IDM 221, I have a good handle on coding and I’m not stumped. Since we are learning to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make our portfolios, I have a growing understanding of how the code I create can make something intriguing. Instead of asking questions when I don’t understand the topic, I’m able to ask questions to deepenre my understanding of the programming involved in that class.
