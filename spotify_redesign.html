                <li> date: January 2023 (Winter) </li>
                <li> type: IDM 101 Project </li>

        <h3 class="title">Intro</h3>
            <p>
                IDM 101 was one of the first classes I took to experience UXID. It was about the history of web development and involved learning how the web grew and changed. Our main project was to pick a website and predesign it (iterate backward) as iterations of Web 1.0, 2.0, and so on.
            </p>
        <h3 class="title">Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                I chose Spotify as my website since it was one that I used day to day and I thought it would be interesting to redesign. This was also the first time I used Figma. It was extremely new to me, but I was really curious to figure things out. I ended up having a lot of fun with this project since I was able to use all the components and tools in Figma to create something I hadnâ€™t before. It was a challenge to iterate Spotify backwards in time conceptually. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite instance consisted of taking up the challenge to redesign the browser frame as well as the Spotify page! I had the opportunity to fully immerse my project into the era it was supposed to emulate, I went all for it. I had fun creating the components and icons from the shapes and tools Figma offered and mastered them. I had fun using ones like the drop shadow for the back arrow. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a refreshing challenge to use my reference image to design my version of the Netscape browser. It was rewarding to look at my design and feel proud about creating every component on the screen! I look forward to trying more challenges like this in the future, and seeing how far the possibilities go!
